The Georgia Public Defender Council convened its spring training session for Circuit Public Defenders in Brunswick, Georgia, covering a broad agenda of operational reforms, leadership development, and strategic priorities for the state's public defense system. The gathering served as both a professional development opportunity and an occasion to welcome new leadership, as Joshua Brockington was formally sworn in as the new Circuit Public Defender for the Atlantic Judicial Circuit during the event.

A major focus of the training was the announcement of a significant restructuring of the GPDC's Capital Division. Chief Counsel Natalie Glaser outlined an overhaul of the division's approach to death penalty case management, describing changes designed to improve coordination, resource allocation, and the quality of representation in capital cases. The reforms reflect the agency's ongoing effort to ensure that the most serious cases receive the highest standard of defense.

> "Client-centered service means meeting people where they are and understanding the full scope of their circumstances, not just their charges."

Joy Walker led a session on client-centered service delivery, emphasizing the importance of treating every individual with dignity and building trust through consistent, responsive communication. Her presentation challenged attendees to examine their office practices through the lens of the people they serve, rather than focusing solely on caseload metrics.

Deputy Director D'Andre Berry addressed the critical need for accurate and timely data entry in JCATS, the agency's case tracking system. Berry stressed that reliable data is essential for securing funding, demonstrating workload demands to the legislature, and identifying areas where additional resources are needed most. Don Plummer presented on media relations, urging Circuit Public Defenders to take a proactive approach to engaging with journalists and shaping public understanding of the role and value of public defense work.

Executive Director Omotayo Alli used the occasion to reflect on her five years leading the agency, outlining the progress made since her appointment and the challenges that remain ahead. She reiterated her commitment to building a public defense system that is well-resourced, professionally managed, and dedicated to the constitutional right to counsel for every Georgian who needs it.
