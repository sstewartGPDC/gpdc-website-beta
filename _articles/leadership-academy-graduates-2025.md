The Georgia Public Defender Council hosted a recognition ceremony at the Georgia State Capitol on May 30, 2025, to honor graduates of the GPDC Leadership Academy. The event assembled graduates, agency officials, state representatives, and community stakeholders to celebrate the program's completion and acknowledge professional development achievements from the past year.

Clayton Judicial Circuit Superior Court Judge Jewel C. Scott delivered the keynote address, drawing upon her public service background. She emphasized that effective leadership emphasizes "motion, not a microphone," and that true leaders maintain their purpose even without widespread recognition.

Tracy Arner, Interim Associate Director at the Carl Vinson Institute of Government, reinforced the importance of continuous professional development, noting that participants have strengthened their professional voices and influence across Georgia.

> "I am very proud of this group of dedicated public defenders who have committed to growing their skills."
> -- Executive Director Omotayo Alli

Developed in partnership with The University of Georgia's Carl Vinson Institute of Government, the Leadership Academy cultivates purpose-driven leaders throughout Georgia's public defense system. Over twelve months, participants engage in 28 days of leadership training emphasizing collaborative learning and project-based initiatives to enhance public defense practices.

Graduates presented capstone projects addressing statewide rehabilitation databases, attorney mentoring models, and gardening programs for detained youth. Several participants reflected on their experiences, with Assistant Public Defender Aisha Broderick noting that she discovered "leadership is not about titles" but rather supporting others.

Circuit Public Defender Ricardo Samper reported becoming an advocate for the program among colleagues, while Ashley McLaughlin shared that the experience improved him "both personally and professionally."
