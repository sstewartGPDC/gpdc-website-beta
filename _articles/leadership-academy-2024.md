The Georgia Public Defender Council launched its 2024-2025 Leadership Academy in September with 22 attorneys selected from approximately 400 statewide applicants. The nine-month program received recognition at a welcome dinner attended by executive leadership.

> "This academy demonstrates our commitment to preparing the rising generation of public defender leaders and reflects institutional investment in attorney development and advancement opportunities."
> -- Executive Director Omotayo Alli

John Wilson, a Columbus-based public defender and 2023-2024 graduate, shared that despite initial uncertainty, he emerged from the program "reinvigorated and brimming with new ways of thinking."

The inaugural three-day session, developed by UGA's Carl Vinson Institute of Government, featured interactive workshops on leadership communication and relationship-building.

Donna Seagraves, Piedmont Circuit Public Defender and keynote speaker, provided historical context on Georgia's public defense system. She traced the 2003 transition from the Georgia Indigent Defense Council to GPDC, explaining it aimed to address inconsistent funding and enhance representation for low-income individuals.

Seagraves, a Council member with 37 years of experience, noted structural advantages of the agency's governance model, particularly regarding gubernatorial appointment influence on legislative outcomes. She highlighted 2022's HB 1391, groundbreaking pay parity legislation between Circuit Public Defenders and District Attorneys.

Recent GPDC initiatives under Director Alli's leadership include the Client Support Services Unit, Youth Advocacy Division, Specialized Gang/RICO Unit, Cross-Circuit Representation Program, GPDC University training platform, revamped in-person training, CLE cost coverage for 12 annual hours, and the Leadership Academy itself.

Remaining sessions occur in Young Harris, Stone Mountain, Helena, Peachtree City, Dawsonville, Pine Mountain, Jekyll Island, and Athens, culminating in May 2025 graduation at the University of Georgia. Participants will earn continuing legal education credits through the Institute of Government for completion.

The GPDC represents 85 percent of Georgians charged with crimes across Juvenile, State, and Superior Courts through 45 circuit offices statewide.
