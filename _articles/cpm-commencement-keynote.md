GPDC Executive Director Omotayo Alli served as the keynote speaker at the Certified Public Manager program commencement ceremony held on May 15, 2025, in Athens, Georgia. The event celebrated 104 graduates who successfully completed one of the most rigorous professional development programs available to public sector leaders in the state.

The CPM program, administered through the University of Georgia's Carl Vinson Institute of Government, requires participants to complete 300 hours of coursework spanning 24 separate modules, along with a capstone project demonstrating practical application of their training. The curriculum is designed to sharpen management skills, deepen understanding of government operations, and prepare leaders to drive meaningful improvements within their agencies.

Alli, who was appointed Executive Director of the GPDC in 2020 by Governor Brian Kemp, holds the distinction of being both the first woman and the first person of color to lead the agency. In her commencement address, she shared four guiding leadership principles that have shaped her career: develop a thorough understanding of the work your organization does, invest in honest self-assessment, treat every person with genuine respect, and be willing to acknowledge and learn from mistakes.

> "Knowing who you are and being honest about your strengths and weaknesses is the foundation of effective leadership."

Beyond those core tenets, Alli spoke about the importance of mentorship in professional growth, encouraging graduates to both seek guidance from experienced leaders and to serve as mentors themselves. She also addressed the role of personal wellness in sustaining a long and productive career in public service, noting that leaders who neglect their own well-being cannot effectively support the people and communities they serve.

The ceremony recognized graduates from agencies across Georgia's state and local government landscape, reflecting the broad reach and impact of the CPM program in building a more capable and committed public workforce.
