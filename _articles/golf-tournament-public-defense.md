The 2025 Georgia Public Defense Foundation (GPDF) Golf Tournament served as a fundraising event and community demonstration supporting public defense initiatives. Held April 1, 2025, at TPC Sugarloaf in Duluth, Georgia, the inaugural tournament brought together golfers, sponsors, and community members.

Proceeds benefited the Georgia Public Defender Council's work, including attorney training and the Ladders Program, which provides mentorship and vocational training to youth ages 16-24 reentering society.

> "This tournament went beyond the game--it built pathways for justice and opportunities for individuals to rise above challenges."
> -- Executive Director Omotayo Alli

The event was held at a 27-hole championship course designed by Greg Norman that hosts PGA Tour events. Donations remained open following the tournament to extend its impact.

The Georgia Public Defender Council represents approximately 85% of indigent criminal defendants in Georgia, while the Georgia Public Defense Foundation operates as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit supporting public defender training and recidivism-reduction programs.
