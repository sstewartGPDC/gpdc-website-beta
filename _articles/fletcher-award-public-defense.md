On July 21, 2025, the Georgia Public Defender Council held a special reception in Athens, Georgia, to pay tribute to retired Chief Justice Norman S. Fletcher and unveil a new annual award bearing his name. The gathering brought together members of the legal community, public defenders, and state officials to recognize the lasting influence Chief Justice Fletcher has had on indigent defense in Georgia.

Now 91 years old, Chief Justice Fletcher served on the Georgia Supreme Court for 16 years, including four as Chief Justice. Over the course of his judicial career, he authored more than 800 legal opinions and participated in over 26,000 cases. His most enduring contribution to public defense came in 2003, when he delivered a pivotal address to the Georgia General Assembly calling attention to the inadequacies of the state's indigent defense system. That speech is widely credited with spurring the passage of the Georgia Indigent Defense Act, which in turn led to the establishment of the GPDC.

> "Chief Justice Fletcher's courage in speaking before the General Assembly changed the trajectory of public defense in Georgia forever."

The newly created Norman S. Fletcher Award for Excellence in Public Defense will be presented annually to a public defender who exemplifies dedication, compassion, and outstanding service to clients. The inaugural recipient was Sherry D. Widner, the Circuit Public Defender for the Pataula Judicial Circuit. Judge Craig Ernest, who has worked alongside Widner in court, praised her exceptional care for her clients and her tireless work ethic as qualities that set her apart in the field.

The reception also recognized GPDC attorneys who have reached 20 years of service to the agency, honoring their long-standing commitment to defending the rights of Georgians who cannot afford legal representation. The event underscored the Council's ongoing mission to strengthen public defense across the state and to celebrate those whose efforts have made a meaningful difference.
