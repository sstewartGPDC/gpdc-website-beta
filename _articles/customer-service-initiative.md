The Georgia Public Defender Council (GPDC) has announced a new customer service initiative designed to strengthen client relations and improve service quality across its operations.

> "This initiative aims to proactively address client concerns and improve our responsiveness while maintaining high defense standards."
> -- Executive Director Omotayo Alli

The Customer Support and Compliance Unit operates under the leadership of Joy Walker, a managing attorney, and Vera Moore, customer service manager. Their responsibilities include managing complaints through confidential channels, conducting investigations, and producing accountability reports.

Walker explained that "clients can file confidential complaints in-person, by mail, over the phone, and through online forms." The unit prioritizes prompt responses and maintains open communication to prevent escalation.

Key features of the initiative include:

- Mandatory attorney training on new procedures
- Consistent application of standards across all jurisdictions
- Data collection for performance evaluation
- Annual reporting on outcomes and improvements

The initiative supports Governor Brian Kemp's broader government service enhancement efforts.
