            <p>The Georgia Public Defender Council held its 2025 Summer Conference from July 21 through 25 at the University of Georgia, drawing more than 600 attendees from across the state's public defense system. The week-long event was organized around the theme of building excellence and empowering advocacy, and it served as both a major training opportunity and a gathering point for the statewide public defense community.</p>

            <p>The conference featured over 60 sessions organized across five training tracks, covering topics relevant to attorneys at every stage of their careers. Subject areas ranged from trial strategy and evidence handling to client communication, mental health defense, and office management. A dedicated Trial Skills Institute provided intensive, hands-on courtroom training specifically designed for early-career attorneys, giving newer defenders the opportunity to practice and refine their skills under the guidance of experienced practitioners.</p>

            <blockquote>The conference also served as the launching point for the 2025-2026 Leadership Academy class, continuing the Council's investment in developing the next generation of public defense leaders across Georgia.</blockquote>

            <p>Among the highlights of the week was the presentation of the inaugural Justice Norman S. Fletcher Award, a new honor recognizing outstanding contributions to public defense in Georgia. The first recipient was Sherry D. Widner, whose career has been marked by sustained dedication to ensuring quality legal representation for indigent defendants. The award is named for former Chief Justice Norman S. Fletcher, who at 91 years old attended the ceremony and received a Legacy Award acknowledging his lasting influence on the state's justice system.</p>

            <p>The five-day format allowed for a depth of programming that shorter conferences cannot achieve. Attendees had the opportunity to attend multiple sessions across different tracks, participate in networking events, and engage directly with Council leadership about the direction of public defense in Georgia. The scale of the event, with more than 600 participants, reflects the size and scope of the GPDC's statewide operation.</p>

            <p>The 2025 Summer Conference reinforced the Council's role as a central hub for professional development, policy discussion, and community building within Georgia's public defense system. By combining practical skills training with recognition of outstanding service and the launch of new leadership initiatives, the event demonstrated a comprehensive approach to strengthening public defense at every level.</p>
