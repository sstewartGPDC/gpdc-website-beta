            <p>Mark Alexander has been named the new Circuit Public Defender for the Northeastern Judicial Circuit, bringing more than three decades of courtroom experience to a role that carries significant responsibility for indigent defense in the region. Alexander succeeds Brad Morris, who served in the position for over twenty years and oversaw the handling of more than 67,000 cases during his tenure.</p>

            <p>Alexander's legal career has spanned multiple areas of practice. He began as an Assistant District Attorney in Gainesville in 1990, where he developed his trial skills as a prosecutor. He later transitioned into civil trial work, building a reputation as an effective litigator across a range of case types. His move into public defense marks a return to criminal law and a new chapter dedicated to serving those who cannot afford private counsel.</p>

            <blockquote>Executive Director Samuel Alli commended Alexander's extensive courtroom skill and his deep commitment to public service, noting that his breadth of experience across prosecution and civil litigation positions him well to lead the Northeastern Circuit office.</blockquote>

            <p>Alexander holds an undergraduate degree from Clemson University and earned his law degree from Mercer University School of Law. Beyond his courtroom work, he has been an active participant in the governance of the legal profession, serving on the State Bar of Georgia's Board of Governors since 2012. That involvement has given him a broad perspective on the challenges and opportunities facing the justice system statewide.</p>

            <p>The Northeastern Circuit covers a busy caseload, and Alexander's combination of prosecutorial insight, civil litigation discipline, and professional leadership experience gives him a well-rounded foundation for managing the office. His appointment signals a continued emphasis on experienced, service-oriented leadership within Georgia's public defender system.</p>
