            <p>The Georgia Public Defender Council held its inaugural Youth Defense Conference on May 8-9, 2025, in Peachtree City, Georgia, bringing together juvenile defense attorneys, judges, and subject-matter experts for two days of focused training on the unique challenges facing young people in the justice system. Alfonso Kraft, Director of the GPDC's Youth Advocacy Division, opened the conference and set the tone for a program built around practical skills and emerging best practices.</p>

            <p>The conference agenda covered a wide range of topics relevant to juvenile defense. Cindy Wang and Trey Scott from the Department of Juvenile Justice led a session on Children in Need of Services (CHINS) cases, exploring the legal framework and practical strategies for representing youth in these proceedings. Additional sessions addressed truancy intervention approaches and the intersection of education law with juvenile defense, with attorney Craig Goodmark providing in-depth guidance on navigating Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) and advocating for students with disabilities within the school system.</p>

            <blockquote>"Defending young people effectively requires an understanding of not just the courtroom, but the school systems, social services, and communities they come from."</blockquote>

            <p>A judicial panel featuring judges from DeKalb County, Georgia, and Fairfax County, Virginia, offered attendees a rare opportunity to hear directly from the bench about courtroom expectations, effective advocacy techniques, and cross-jurisdictional perspectives on juvenile justice reform. The inclusion of an out-of-state jurist provided valuable insight into how different states are tackling similar challenges in youth defense.</p>

            <p>National experts rounded out the program with specialized workshops. Kris Henning from Georgetown University Law Center conducted a session focused on developmental considerations in juvenile defense and effective communication with young clients. Randee Waldman from Emory University School of Law led a motions practice workshop, equipping attendees with practical tools for stronger written advocacy on behalf of their young clients.</p>

            <p>The conference marked an important step in the GPDC's commitment to building a dedicated community of juvenile defense practitioners across Georgia, with plans to make the event an annual gathering for continued learning and collaboration.</p>
