            <p>Katherine “Kate” Mason, a longtime Augusta public defender and former statewide leader with the Georgia Public Defender Council (GPDC), was honored at a retirement celebration. The event also included the swearing-in of Lee Prescott as circuit public defender of the Augusta Judicial Circuit.</p>

            <p>The on Thursday, Feb. 5, 2026, event was held at the Augusta Judicial Circuit Office of the Public Defender located at 902 Greene St., Augusta, GA 30901.</p>

            <p>Mason served as the Augusta Circuit Public Defender from 2011 to 2021 before becoming GPDC’s deputy director of State Level Services overseeing regional alternate defender offices, conflicts programs, and appellate and conflict case management.</p>

            <p>Mason is a University of Georgia School of Law graduate (J.D., 1989, cum laude) and a former board member of the National Association for Public Defense (2016–2023). She was set to receive a commendation from Georgia Governor Brian P. Kemp for her career of service.</p>

            <p>“Kate Mason embodies what public defense is supposed to look like — steady leadership, fearless advocacy, and a deep respect for the people and communities we serve,” said Omotayo B. Alli, executive director of the Georgia Public Defender Council. “Across Augusta and across our statewide system, she built teams, strengthened standards, and mentored lawyers who will carry her example forward. We’re grateful for her service and proud to honor the legacy she leaves."</p>

            <p>Prescott brings more than two decades of public defense and leadership experience. Licensed in Georgia since 2003, he joined GPDC’s Augusta Judicial Circuit public defender office in 2005 and handled complex felony cases while leading trial teams and supervising staff. In 2021, he was appointed chief assistant public defender for the Columbia Judicial Circuit, where he helped set up a new office while keeping an active trial caseload.</p>

            <p>“Lee Prescott is a respected public defender with deep roots in the Augusta community and a strong record of leadership,” Alli said. “He brings the experience and judgment needed to lead the Augusta Circuit and deliver high-quality representation.”</p>

            <p>Prescott earned his law degree from St. Thomas University School of Law and a B.A. in history from Augusta College. As circuit public defender, he assumed responsibility for overseeing constitutionally required representation in the Augusta Judicial Circuit, which includes Richmond County and Burke County.</p>

            <p>“I’m honored to serve the Augusta Circuit and the communities of Richmond and Burke counties,” Prescott said. “Public defense is about protecting constitutional rights and strengthening trust in the justice system.”</p>
